# üõ°Ô∏è XOR Encryption Tool with Discord Webhook Integration

`[FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY]` This project is an encryption tool that encrypts and decrypts files using the XOR cipher. The generated encryption key is securely sent to a Discord webhook for safekeeping.

The tool allows you to encrypt all files in the current directory (except the script itself and the key file) and decrypt them using the same key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **XOR Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts files using a simple XOR cipher.
- **Random Key Generation**: A random encryption key is generated for each encryption session.
- **Key Storage**: The encryption key is saved in a local file (`thekey.key`), or a new one is generated if no key exists.
- **Discord Webhook Integration**: Sends the encryption key to a specified Discord webhook for safekeeping.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Key Generation**: A random encryption key is generated unless a key is already saved in `thekey.key`.
2. **Webhook Notification**: The generated key is sent to the specified Discord webhook.
3. **File Encryption**: All files in the directory (excluding the script and key file) are encrypted using XOR cipher.
4. **Decryption**: When the correct key is provided, the files are decrypted back to their original state.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xor-encryption-tool.git
   cd xor-encryption-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set your Discord webhook URL**

- Replace the placeholder webhook URL in the WEBHOOK_URL variable within the script with your actual Discord webhook URL.

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Running the script:

1. Encrypt Files:

- Run the script to encrypt all files in the current directory (except for the key and script files):

```
python main.py
```

2. Receive Decryption Key:

- After encryption, the key will be sent to your specified Discord webhook. Keep this key safe for decryption.

3. Decrypt Files:

- When prompted, enter the correct key (which was sent to the Discord webhook) to decrypt the files.
